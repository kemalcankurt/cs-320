### Ensuring the software operates as expected is crucial, and this can be accomplished through rigorous testing procedures. Comprehensive testing encompasses unit or integration testing and can verify the software's functionality. Leveraging tools like JUnit tailored for Java can streamline and automate the testing process, ultimately leading to a more reliable and efficient software product.
### By proactively addressing potential flaws in the code, I, as a developer, can prevent security breaches and malfunctions in the software. Static analysis tools like SonarQube - used by most of the companies I worked for - provide a valuable resource for detecting issues early on in the development process, ultimately saving time and resources in the long run. Regularly reviewing code and utilizing these tools is essential for maintaining the reliability of the software, providing developers with the confidence that the software is robust and secure.
### It is vital to connect with stakeholders through meetings to gain a deeper understanding of what they are looking for and expecting. By directly engaging with the audience, developers or teams can gather detailed insights that will enable them to better meet their needs and preferences.
### If you want to create a reliable and long-lasting system, you need a solid architecture. The architecture should handle challenges, adapt to the business's growth, and be easy to manage. By thoughtfully selecting software architecture and technology options, you can create a robust and scalable system that will stand long enough.
